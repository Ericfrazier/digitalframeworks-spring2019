# Assignment 4: Story Pitch

I plan to analyze the path to the NFL between major college football programs such as Alabama, Clemson and Oklahoma and the FCS schools. I want to look more into how many FCS schools put into the draft because their path is a lot more difficult because they dont have the amount of media exposure that the major schools have.

To do this, I will use data from the NFL and other media websites counting down all the schools that had draft picks in the last few years. After every draft, they put on their websites how many picks came out of certain schools.

I could visualize the information in a chart with the Name of the schools at the top and the years to the side and put the number of draft picks under each school

This is timely because this data could help an up and coming star high school player that has NFL dreams find the right school that can get them to the draft.

For sources, I could talk the FCS schools as well as an FBS school about their process on how they get players ready for the draft and how do they get players to the NFL.
