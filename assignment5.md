# Assignment 5: Interview a dataset

"Interview" a dataset with three specific, interesting questions.

Turn in:

1. A link to the dataset (which you can include in your repository), your questions, as well as the answers to those questions.  
2. Additionally, write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas. 
3. Lastly, write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting of the three questions.

This analysis can be related to your final project, but does not have to be.
