**Assignment 7**

I found that a lot of music artists, especially from the hip hop community overwhelmingly favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump with verbal political endorsements in the 2016 election but I wondered who put money into her campaign.

To follow up on this story, I researched the web to find articles of artists that came out vocally for Hillary Clinton and then look up on the FEC site to see who actually donated to her campaign only to find out that out of 22 people that came out in support for Hillary Clinton, only three people actually made a financial contribution. So, the main story is why these other high-profile artists didn’t kick in any money to the Campaign This story would likely take two days to report.

In order to find my story, I did the following:

1. Searched the FEC website for donations in the 2016 election cycle from the names of artists that vocally supported Hillary Clinton
2. Filtered to only contributions to Hillary For America and exported a CSV file of the results
3. For the CSV, I didn’t have to do too much because there were only three artists out of 22 that made a financial contribution to the Hillary for America Campaign: Young Jeezy, Kanye West and Beyoncé.

Hed: Clinton has vocal supporters but little donors

Nut graf: Many artists from the music industry, primarily hip hop, came out in droves to show their vocal support for Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaign against Donald Trump. However, when I looked up the 22 artists to see who chipped in financially to the Campaign, only three artists made a financial contribution to the effort. Those artists were Young Jeezy, Kanye West and Beyoncé.
