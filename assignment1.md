Story about Bernie’s run to the 2020 election. How can Bernie turn the tide and win the democratic nomination and the presidency.

The background for this topic is the fact that election season is coming and once again Bernie Sanders is running for president of the United States. Last time around, Bernie was a virtual unknown in the race and came out of nowhere to make a name for himself even though he was screwed out of the primary by the DNC. The article that I found that made me suggest this topic shows data on how Bernie’s 2020 bid is shaping up to be better than his 2016 bid. The data shows that he is leaps and bounds ahead of where he was at in 2016 and has a better chance of winning the democratic nomination this year.

   * The fact that Bernie Sanders presidential campaign quest was off to a better start this time around than the 2016 campaign ?
   * Yes it was in the headline
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? On a scale of 1 to 5, I was able to rate this a 4, it was ok to navigate the data but it wasnt the best.
   * For what was presented on the website, yes.
   * I can say make the graphs more clearer to better explain the data.

   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.I would question the polling part of the article mainly the graph part because the source listed for the graph is its own website. I just wonder how they were able to come up with that data on their own.
   * I would have the reporter check with the networks as well as the neilsen ratings as well as the election websites

### Objective: Quality

* The story was excuted with a high degree of quality I would rank it 5. 
   * The reporter did a good job with presenting the story visually with the graphics as well as printwise with telling the story about Bernie's campaign trail. I would improve on having more picture elements to the story to make it better visually.
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * The graphics accomplished all tasks that they were trying to show the reader. They were presented well, There was great comparison from the 2016 campaign to the 2020 campaign. It was organized in a great matter that made it easy to read and figure out. The graphs did correlate with what the story was trying to tell the reader.
   

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? Yes the reporter used the color and type to their best purposes.
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together? It did looked like it belonged all together espeically with the first graph in which it showed the amount of coverage Bernie recieved in the beginning of the 2016 campaign from CNN, Fox News and MSNBC compaired to when he announced his 2020 bid.
       * Yes it drew my eye to the most important information that related to the story.
       * Yes everything made sense the colors worked perfectly to tell the difference between the networks and the difference between Sanders and the other candidiates.
* Type (5)
   * The reporter used the graphics in the right matter that told the story in an effective way and made it easy to follow.
*Color (5)
   * The reporter used the colors effectively to make the graphics easier to read and to follow the story. The reader could easly differnicate between the networks and the relation between Sanders and the other candidates.
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? Yes the piece used creative elements to a good effect.  There was no random junk in the creative elements that I would consider distraticng. It was used in all good taste to better tell the story.
   * It was used effectivly in the first part of the story to enhance and emphasize the coverage Bernie Sanders recived in the 2016 election compaired to his bid in 2020.
   * I would rate it a 4 

# new report

Story about sports free agency in the off season and how they help a team grow and get better for next season. In major league sports, the offseason is the one of the best parts of each season. Players get signed to the teams that they are currently on or they get picked up by other teams. The article that I saw to work to this topic was about MLB free agency and players getting signed to mass extensions to their contracts in order to keep with them with teams for a long time. I would look more into the NFL and NBA since I have greater interest in those sports over MLB.

# Data reporting critiques

This is a critique of the 538 article titled What's Behind MLB's Bizarre Spike In Contract Extensions by Travis Sawchik

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* I was somewhat able to identify the the central insight that the reporter was able to communicate. On a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate it a 3. 
   * It was explaing why there were a spike in MLB contract extensions but the report itself was very confusing and hard to follow and read
   * Yes it was in the headline.
* It took me sometime to navigate the data. I would had to go through the entire article to get a better understanding of what they were talking about. I would rate it a 3.
   * It was the best way for me to navigate the article since a lot of information was thrown at me to analyze.
   * Make the data more clearer and present the data better with graphs than just throwing numbers at us to follow the story.
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? I think that the data was somewhat accurate. There were so many numbers thrown at us to belive it was accurate with sources but it was hard to follow so I would rate it a 3.
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.I would question all of the parts of the data that was just listed in numbers in the story and not presented in a graph.
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. I would check with MLB to get the main scoops about the salaries. I would also check with the player's agent to get a better explaination on why they are trying to get these extentions and I would check other sports reporting media outlets for confirmation on this subject.
   * Did they provide a source? Yes they provided a source for the one graph they made for the story and they provided a main source in the beginning  of the story with link to that sotry 
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? I feel that the report tried his best to explain what was going on in the story but it was just hard to follow.

### Objective: Quality

* The story itself was excuted at a high degree of quality but the way it was presnted wasnt a high degree of quality. On a scale of 1 to 5, I rank it a 3. (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
   * The reporter did an excellent job of getting the information in order to write the story and it was enough information that you could somewhat understand what was going on. The way it was presented was the problem and it was just saturated in the story and it made the story hard to follow and read.
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * The one graphic that was used in the story did not accomplish all task listed.
   * It wasnt organzied or it didnt correlate or advance the story.

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? No.
   * For example, did it: 
       * It was used to show a difference between two different parts of the contract but it didnt explain it in great detail.
       * It drew my eye to what they were trying to present but it was hard to understand.
       * It didnt make sense at all. I had a hard time of understanding what they were trying to explain with the graph.
* Type (3)
   * It didnt explain what they were trying to present to the audience and it was hard to follow
*Color (5)
   * It clearly defined the different topics that they were trying to present to the audience.
   
### Objective: Creativity

* No the piece did not use creative elements to good effect.
   * It was one graph in the story that tried to explain part of the story but it wasnt explained in great detail and the article was hard to follow. The graphic was not distracting.
   * Rate of effectiveness a 2 out of 5
