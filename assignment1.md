# Data reporting critiques

This is a critique of the 538 article titled Sanders 2020 is Off to a Faster Start than Sanders 2016 by Oliver Roeder

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* On a scale from 1 to 5 I would rate this article a 5 in that I was able to identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate. 
   * The fact that Bernie Sanders presidential campaign quest was off to a better start this time around than the 2016 campaign ?
   * Yes it was in the headline
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? On a scale of 1 to 5, I was able to rate this a 4, it was ok to navigate the data but it wasnt the best.
   * For what was presented on the website, yes.
   * I can say make the graphs more clearer to better explain the data.
* Yes I think the data was accurate based on my own knowledge on the subject on how Bernie was covered during the 2016 election. I would rate it a 5 a 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.I would question the polling part of the article mainly the graph part because the source listed for the graph is its own website. I just wonder how they were able to come up with that data on their own.
   * I would have the reporter check with the networks as well as the neilsen ratings as well as the election websites
   * Did they provide a source? Yes they provided sources for each graph presented in the article
   * Yes they explained everthing that needed explaining.

### Objective: Quality

* The story was excuted with a high degree of quality I would rank it 5. 
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. The reporter did a good job with presenting the story visually with the graphics as well as printwise with telling the story about Bernie's campaign trail. I would improve on having more picture elements to the story to make it better visually.
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks? The graphics accomplished all tasks that they were trying to show the reader. They were presented well, There was great comparison from the 2016 campaign to the 2020 campaign. It was organized in a great matter that made it easy to read and figure out. The graphs did correlate with what the story was trying to tell the reader.
   

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? Yes the reporter used the color and type to their best purposes.
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together? It did looked like it belonged all together espeically with the first graph in which it showed the amount of coverage Bernie recieved in the beginning of the 2016 campaign from CNN, Fox News and MSNBC compaired to when he announced his 2020 bid.
       * Yes it drew my eye to the most important information that related to the story.
       * Yes everything made sense the colors worked perfectly to tell the difference between the networks and the difference between Sanders and the other candidiates.
* Type (5)
   * The reporter used the graphics in the right matter that told the story in an effective way and made it easy to follow.
*Color (5)
   * The reporter used the colors effectively to make the graphics easier to read and to follow the story. The reader could easly differnicate between the networks and the relation between Sanders and the other candidates.
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? Yes the piece used creative elements to a good effect.  There was no random junk in the creative elements that I would consider distraticng. It was used in all good taste to better tell the story.
   * It was used effectivly in the first part of the story to enhance and emphasize the coverage Bernie Sanders recived in the 2016 election compaired to his bid in 2020.
   * I would rate it a 4

# Data reporting critiques

You'll use this template several times during the quarter to critique published reporting you find and to learn to think critically about data and visuals.

This is almost entirely from [Alberto Cairo](https://twitter.com/albertocairo) at the University of Miami and [Pat Howe](https://twitter.com/pchowe?lang=en) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 
   * What was it?
   * Was it in the headline?
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. 
   * Did they provide a source?
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks?
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together?
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)
   * Explain
*Color (1-5)
   * Explain
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * How?
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.
