The 2019 NFL draft has come and gone and this is a time where prominent college football players are drafted into the league. One thing that I have noticed is that most of the players drafted are from major college football programs that are in the Football Bowl Subdivison or (FBS) rather than the Football Championship Subdivison or (FCS).

I decided to break down the picks from four major schools combined with all the FCS in the years 2015-2019:
* The Alabama Crimson Tide's picks
* The Clemson Tigers picks 
* The Oklahoma Sooners picks
* The Ohio State Buckeyes pics
* The FCS picks 

I will collect the data by watching the draft to see who got picked and researching the prior years drafts to break down the analysis of how NFL teams pick the their players in the draft. The main reason why I am picking this topic is because the FCS schools face an unfair disadvantage when it comes to putting its players in the NFL because most of the players chosen are not only from FBS schools but FBS schools that have prominent football programs. I picked Alabama, CLemson, Oklahoma and Ohio State because they are the most prominet schools in the FBS.
